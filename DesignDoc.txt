-SECGEN-
SecGen is a tool designed to generate a sector of a galaxy, either as a rollplaying tool, or to help with world building.

-Features-
Randomly generate a sector of space based on a series of lists containting appropriate names and qualities of astral bodies.
The sector is stored as a database with a "stars" table and a "planets" table

    -Main Window
    In the main window there are two primary views, the "Sector View" and the "System View". Both are labeled frames containing grids of images.

        -Sector View
        The sector view contains a grid of images representing either empty space or a star. The stars come from a table called "stars" which
        contains their names and attributes.

        Clicking on a grid coordinate should pull up the associated system in the system view.

        -System View
        The system view contains a packed group of images with the system's star at the top and then its planets below it, in order of how far
        they are from the star.
        
        Clicking on a planet should pull up info in an info panel, below the systme view. Planet information is pulled from a the "planets" table.

    -Save and Load Sectors

        -Load
        Sectors (databases) should be savable for later use, and loaded either from a list, or a file selector
    
    -Edit Star/Planet

        -Edit
        All data should be in text, and editable by user. There will be an "edit star" and an "edit system" button, either of which will pull up a menu
        allowing for changes to a given item.
